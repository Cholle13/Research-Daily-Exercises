# Daily Coding Exercises

###  Day 2 - File IO
Now that you have reviewed some of the basics with printing and formatting we will move on
to file input and output.  

File IO is very important in research. Most of the scripts you will write are going to have
at least one file that is used as input and at least one file for output.  

Tips when naming files:
- Stay consistent in you naming convention.
- Use descriptive file names (input.csv vs FEHM_Model_Calibration_Data.csv).
- When you have multiple files being output use a file number at the end of the name.
Example: Moisture_Data_1.csv, Moisture_Data_2.csv etc.
- Do not use spaces in your file names.
- Include the extension (generally it will be a *.csv or *.txt extension)

Now time for some code. The process will be the same as yesterday. Type out the code provided 
and try to determine what the output will be. Do not copy and paste. There will be a few short
challenges in the comments, this will help you think about what you've learned and apply it.
Good luck!
